Hi, my name is Dane Larsen. I'm a second year Master's student studying
Computer Science at the University of Colorado (at) Boulder. I've been
seriously programming for about seven years now, with some brief
experimentation before that with BASIC on a ZX81 that my Dad helped me build
from a kit.  

I'm good with C, C++, Python, Qt4, OpenGL/GLSL, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/RHEL),
Vim, Git, networking, web (both front and backend), embedded and more. I know
how to solder and do basic electronics work, although it comes with the
disclaimer that I'm only self taught and probably have significant gaps in my
knowledge of everything below the assembly abstraction layer.  

I'm currently interested in machine learning (the subject area of my thesis),
woodworking, blacksmithing and hobby electronics.

I've worked as a student software developer at the <a
href="http://lasp.colorado.edu">Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space
Physics</a> since May of 2010. I helped rebuild the entire GUI layer for their
in-house spacecraft command and control application. I wrote about half of a 3D
OpenGL-based science visualization tool that is actively used by scientists on
the the <a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/">MESSENGER mission to
Mercury</a>. I'm currently the sole developer on a situational awareness tool
used in the day-to-day operations of nine spacecraft.
