# Automated Curtains

I'm in the process of automating my curtains! I want to see if I can modify my
sleep schedule so that I feel more alert earlier in the morning. I hope to do
this by having my blackout curtains open on a preset schedule in the morning so
that I get more natural light. I also plan to augment natural light with 
sunlight-spectrum LEDs synchronized to the curtain schedule to maximize the
effect.

Also, I want to be able to open the curtains with my voice.

# Testing Methodology

Not only do I want to wake up earlier, I want to be more alert right after I
wake up. I plan on verifying the efficacy of my system by creating a small
suite of both subjective and objective tests and then using the gathered
results to see if I can implement an optimal schedule. I expect that I will be
unable to prove that my system is effective, but at least I'll have the placebo
effect and voice activated curtains.
