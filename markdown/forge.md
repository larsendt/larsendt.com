# Building a Forge

When I was a Freshman in high school in 2004, we were offered a beginner
class in blacksmithing and welding, taught by one of the parents who ran a
little local blacksmithing shop. We learned basic manual forging as well as
forging with a pneumatic power hammer, oxy-acetylene welding, stick welding and
MIG welding. 

I had a couple more opportunities to do blacksmithing during high school. I 
never got terribly good at it, but I definitely enjoyed it.

In 2010, the person who taught the course needed an extra pair of hands to help
build a decorative steel fence. He hired me on for two months and I got to do
blacksmithing and welding 5 days a week. I now have a Computer
Science degree (soon to be two), but since then I've joked that if I can't find
a job, I'd fall back on blacksmithing or welding.

Around the end of 2014, a friend of mine sent me a <a
href="http://hackaday.com/2013/07/28/propane-forge-built-from-a-soup-can/">
Hackaday post</a> about making a forge out of a soup can. I figured it would be
a fun side project to do with my Dad, so we started planning. Construction
began in early 2015, and the results are below. Enjoy!

# The Forge Casing

The frugal spin on the forge shown in the Hackaday post was initially interesting,
but my Dad and I quickly decided that we'd rather spend a little more to have
a forge that would last a long time. 

We went with a 6 inch diameter steel pipe instead of a soup can, cut to a
length of 1 foot. We wanted a decent inner diameter, so we figured a 6" outer
diameter with 1 1/2" of insulation would leave a nice space to work in.

I drilled a 1" hole in the center of the casing for the gas inlet. The plan was
to weld on a threaded attachment point for the pipe carrying the propane
and air.

</div>

Here you can see the result of the welding. For the legs, I welded two pieces
of rectangular steel on to the edges of the casing so that the gas inlet would
be horizontal.

also my mediocre welding skills).

Figure 4: Testing the first iteration of the burner - the flame is pretty weak
</div>

In Figure 4, you can see the prototype burner. All of the pipe for the burner
is cast iron pipe. Galvanized pipe can release toxic fumes when heated. The
concern with galvanized pipe seems to mostly revolve around welding it, but 
we figured a little caution couldn't hurt.

Something else to note about Figure 4. We should have a roaring jet. That 
flame would barely cook a hot dog... Not currently pictured here is a diagram
of the internals of the burner. In Figure 4, you can see the 1/4" brass
pipe with the gas valve. That brass pipe runs through a drilled cast iron
plug into the air intake section of the burner. On the end of the brass pipe
is a 1/32" welding tip, which we use to produce a high velocity gas flow (in
theory anyway). We initially figured that the welding tip might be too small.

Figure 6: Semi-fixed burner. It had a bigger flame, but not very strong one.
</div>

In an attempt to increase gas flow, we took out the welding tip, and added
a plug that we drilled with a 1/6" bit. Figure 6 shows the results. The 
flame was bigger, but still not great. The yellow/white feathery flame
means that the combustion is oxygen-poor. 

With this result, we decided to take a break from the burner and work on the 
insulation for the forge.

# Forge Insulation

The original Hackaday post that inspired this project used a mixture of sand
and plaster. While it appears that this works fine as an insulation medium, I
expect that the longevity would be pretty poor. Instead, we went the route of
high-temperature cement. The first thing we tried was <a
href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Hercules-1-2-gal-Furnace-Stove-Cement-35515/202078154">a
high temperature furnace cement from Home Depot</a>.

When we cracked the buckets open, we realized that rather than being a viscous
liquid, it was more the consistency of smoothly ground peanut butter. I went
about jamming it in the form anyway, but about three quarters of the way
though, the base of our form started to collapse. We decided to bail and pull
all the cement out rather than try to recover. This turned out to be an
excellent idea, because we would have been stuck with whatever final form the
cement ended up in. Turns out, it dries rather like a strong epoxy, which makes
it nearly impossible to work with after it's dried.

<a name="figure7"></a>

<br>
Figure 7: First attempt at pouring the forge cement
</div>

Unfortunately, we didn't get any good pictures of the first "pour" (it was more
like jamming peanut butter in with a spatula), because we both were covered in
the cement. Figure 7 shows the form that eventually collapsed on us. We took a
long sheet of aluminum (fairly thick), and rolled it up to the right diameter
so that we had two layers. We figured the double layer would be strong enough,
which technically it was. What we didn't anticipate was the aluminum curling up
even further as the pressure from the cement grew, causing the diameter of our
form to shrink. When we realized the form was collapsing we made a snap
judgement, pulled the form out and scraped all the cement back into the
buckets.

<br>
Figure 8: Second attempt with different cement - much better!
</div>

We switched to a more standard dry-mix cement that is rated for high
temperatures. Also not pictured is our upgraded form (I forgot to grab a photo,
sorry). We used a 3 inch OD plastic pipe wrapped first in 1/4 inch of foam
padding and then saran wrap for easy removal. The total outer diameter was
almost exactly 3.5 inches, precisely what we were aiming for. As Figure 8 shows,
it worked great! We did file down those rough edges a bit and ground off the
cement that had slopped over the edge.

Figure 12: The flame is still kinda weak... We should be hearing a solid roar.
</div>

As you can see in Figure 12, that's not a terribly satisfying forge flame. We
should have a roaring blue flame that's mostly contained to the
insulated chamber, not slow flames with yellow-ish feathery ends. Do we have
insufficient gas pressure? Do we have insufficient airflow? It's hard to see in
the video, but close examination showed that about 90% of the combustion was
occurring outside the main chamber. It was definitely looking like an airflow
problem.

<br>
Figure 13: Yep, definitely an airflow problem.
</div>

Given that we were likely seeing poor airflow, we decided to fire up the air
compressor. You can see the very satisfying results in Figure 13. The sound in
the video really overstates how much air we were giving the burner. We barely
had to feed it any air to get a nice deep roaring flame. I could have probably
produced similar results by lightly blowing into the air inlet.

The first thing we tried to do to improve airflow was switch from the right-
angle T joint to a Y joint. We weren't terribly hopeful, but we already had
the Y joint and figured it was worth a shot.

Turns out, that was the problem! It's hard to see in daylight, but the flames
extend about 6 inches beyond the mouth of the forge. The cement heated up 
to a very nice bright orange.

Figure 16: Pretty HDR picture of the hot forge.
</div>

Here's a clear picture of the heating of the cement. It heats much slower than
what I'm used to. We timed it at about 30 minutes from cold to full heat. I'm
used to forges that use lightweight fire brick, which heats in about half of
that time. We were still reasonably satisfied though. You can see the
beginnings of a project heating in the forge in Figure 16.

We decided that the bent gas inlet was causing more trouble than it was worth,
so we switched to a straight one. Besides making the gas line management easier,
it also marginally improved gas flow.

We noticed an interesting feature early on in the forge heating process. It 
appears that the center of the flame is much colder than the edges, which
results in the cool heated ring you can see in Figure 16.
